She would likely ask them about their purpose for visiting The Seashell Sanctuary and if she could be of any assistance. Oceana would also share some interesting facts about the sea creatures thriving in the underwater city of Pearl Cove and would love to hear about their interests and hobbies as well. In conversation, Oceana would be a great listener, always attentive and showing genuine interest in what the other person has to say."

She radiates an aura of peace and serenity, and her eyes seem to hold a depth of wisdom that is both comforting and intimidating. She nods to the reader, acknowledging their presence, but does not speak. Instead, she returns to her meditation, lost in contemplation of the sea goddess.\n\nAs the reader continues through the building, they catch a glimpse of **Oceana Bluefin** in the gardens outside. She is kneeling beside a bed of sea flowers, carefully tending to them with gentle hands. She looks up as the reader passes by, a shy smile crossing her face, before returning to her work. The reader feels a sense of calm wash over them as they take in the beauty of the surroundings, and they cannot help but feel grateful for the peaceful retreat that **Coralline Wavesong** and **Oceana Bluefin** have created."

She is sitting at her desk, wearing a pair of reading glasses and surrounded by stacks of books, grading papers with a focused look on her face.\n\nAs you make your way down the hallway, you see a group of students gathered around an open classroom door. Curious, you approach and peek inside to see **Luna Star**, a quiet and introverted starfish student, sitting at her desk lost in her own thoughts, while her classmates work on their assignments. \n\nFurther down the hall, you hear the sounds of laughter and chatter coming from a classroom, and you peer inside to see **Maximus Clam**, a boisterous and outgoing clam student, entertaining his classmates with his infectious energy. Finally, you reach a large classroom where **Orlando Octopus**, a multi-talented octopus teacher, is responsible for teaching music, art, and literature. He is playing the piano and his students are gathered around him, singing along and laughing.\n\nAs you explore the Starfish School, you can see that the students and teachers are a close-knit community, each one unique and valued for their individual talents and personalities."

You catch glimpses of merfolk swimming by, chatting with each other or taking a break on the kelp trunks that serve as benches.\n\nYour attention is drawn to a merman with a warm smile and a welcoming demeanor. This must be **Seabert Seashell**, the community organizer. He seems to know everyone and greets each person with a smile and a friendly, \"Good day!\" He is currently chatting with a grumpy, reclusive octopus who is running a small shop. That must be **Octavius Ink**, the ink and quill seller. He doesn't seem to enjoy interacting with others and is currently snapping at a mermaid who is trying to ask him a question.\n\nYou notice a mermaid who is flitting around the courtyard, placing colorful decorations and flowers in various spots. That must be **Coraline Reef**, the creative and artistic mermaid who organizes the events at Kelpwood Commons. She is a perfectionist and is currently directing a group of merfolk who are helping her set up for the next event. Despite her demanding demeanor, you can tell she takes great pride in her work, and the end result is always spectacular. As you take in the scene, you can't help but feel excited to see what events and activities these characters have planned for the community."
